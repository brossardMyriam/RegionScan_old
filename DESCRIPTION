Description: RegionScan is a R package for comprehensive and scalable region-level genome-wide association testing of alternative region-level multiple-variant and single-variant statistics and visualization of the results. It implements various state-of-the-art region-level tests to improve signal detection under heterogeneous genetic architectures and comparison of multiple-variant region-level and single-variant test results. It leverages LD-based genomic partitioning for LD-adaptive region definition. RegionScan is compatible with VCF input file format, and accommodates parallel region-level processing and analysis to improve computational time and memory efficiency. It also provide options for analysis of multi-allelic variants, unbalanced binary phenotypes, with detailed outputs for results interpretation, and utility functions for visualization, comparison, and interpretation.
